# Capture the Flag

Using CTF challenges from [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/) as an excuse to get practice with Node.

**Spoiler:** this repo contains solutions.

My approach for these puzzles:

- Aim to balance brevity and clarity.
- Focus on the subject of each specific challenge, rather than watertight architecture (hallo global scope, goodbye error handling).
- Prioritize moving onto new challenges, rather than refining working solutions.
