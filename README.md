# Capture the Flag

Using CTF challenges from [picoCTF Gym](https://play.picoctf.org/) as an excuse to get practice with Node and Jest.

This repo refers to the challenges by their original name, (i.e. the only naming convention is "there is no convention").

**Spoiler:** this repo contains solutions.

My approach for these puzzles:

- Aim to balance brevity and clarity.
- Focus on the subject of each specific challenge, rather than watertight architecture (hallo global scope, goodbye error handling. I did end up adding unit tests though).
- Prioritize moving onto new challenges, rather than refining working solutions (exceptions made for interesting challenges, when I have the time).

## tl;dr

The most developed solution so far is for the challenge titled [13](./crypto/13/).
